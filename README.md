# Hi there, I'm Aaryan 👋

I'm an Aerospace Engineering student at the University of Sydney 🛫, with a growing passion for simulation, control systems, and intelligent automation. I explore the intersection of engineering, code, and real-world applications — whether it’s simulating a rocket injector, animating a falling object, or visualizing data .

### 🚀 What I’m working on:
- Aerodynamic case studies
- Data analysis + visualization projects in Python & R 📊
- Signal processing for EEG-based seizure detection 🧠
- Personal simulations: from particle dynamics to crime density mapping 🌐

### 🧰 Tools & Languages I Use:
- Python 
- MATLAB / Simulink
- SolidWorks (CAD)
- Jupyter & LaTeX
- Git & GitHub (version control)
- R (for statistical modeling)
- Adobe Creative Cloud

### 📘 Currently Learning:
- Control Systems (PID, real-time applications)
- CFD basics (Ansys Fluent coming soon 👀)
- Reinforcement Learning for robotics
- Better workflows with Conda, Makefiles, and GitHub Actions

### 🌱 Outside of code...
- I love music (all types)
- I cook my own food while debugging
- I occasionally animate physics and aesthetic systems 🎞️
- I play football ⚽️
